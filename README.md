# Photon Ranch Image Stats (Deprecated)

This repository handles user image analysis and statistics for checking 
image quality at Photon Ranch sites. It has API endpoints for radial stellar 
profiles (including identifying brightest star, median star, and number of 
good stars as well as graphing radial profiles) and region stats (mean, median, 
std, min, max of region).

Repository has been archived and is read only, as code is outdated and analysis is now expanded and handled by [the quickanalysis repository](https://github.com/LCOGT/quickanalysis).
